Krushkal's algorithm: To find min cost spanning tree.
  Process: Start from the shortest edge and pick the next shortest edge from the remaining edges (might be discontinuous)
  
Problem statement: I have a set S in which each element belongs to some partition (or component).
  I want to determine: given an element s, which component does it belong to? [Find operation]
                     & merging 2 components [Union operation]
                     
Krushkal's: Naive implementation - maintain an array of elements containing components, Store the edges being added.
